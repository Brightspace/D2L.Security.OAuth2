D2L.Security.AuthTokenProvisioning
==============================

This library allows provisioning of auth tokens from the auth server. As part of the provisioning process, information such as a user ID, tenant ID, etc. can be included in the provisioned token.

Each consumer of this library will have to be trusted by the auth server via a private/public key pair.
